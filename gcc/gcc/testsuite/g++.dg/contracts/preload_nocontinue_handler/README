build and install gcc to $prefix, then run:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$prefix/lib64 CXX=$prefix/bin/g++ make run
  Build and run with continuation mode on; will print violation info from the
  standard handler and then continue to print "returning from main"

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$prefix/lib64 CXX=$prefix/bin/g++ make runnostd
  Build and run with continuation mode on, using the default violation handler
  while preloading the 'nocontinue' hook. This uses LD_PRELOAD to turn all
  continuing contract violations into non-continuing versions.

  Will print violation info from the standard handler and then terminate -- it
  will not print "returning from main"

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$prefix/lib64 CXX=$prefix/bin/g++ make runno
  Build and run with continuation mode on, using a custom violation handler
  while preloading the 'nocontinue' hook. This uses LD_PRELOAD to turn all
  continuing contract violations into non-continuing versions and to install a
  custom violation handler.

  Will print violation info from the custom handler and then terminate -- it
  will not print "returning from main"
