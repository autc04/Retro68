/* This code snippet from glibc 2.3.5 was causing an ICE during
   optimization because we were failing to update the SSA form for
   stale name tags.  These are tags that are associated with SSA pointers
   that have been removed from the IL.  This was causing the SSA
   verifier to fail before we had a chance to run the cleanup pass that
   finally removes all the remaining PHI nodes for the stale name tag.  */
