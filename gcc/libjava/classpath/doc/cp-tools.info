1.1 The `appletviewer' Tool
===========================

SYNOPSIS

   appletviewer [OPTION]... URL...
appletviewer [OPTION]... `-code' CODE
appletviewer [OPTION]... `-plugin' INPUT,OUTPUT

   DESCRIPTION The `appletviewer' tool loads and runs an applet.

   Use the first form to test applets specified by tag.  The URL should
resolve to an HTML document from which the `appletviewer' will extract
applet tags.  The APPLET, EMBED and OBJECT tags are supported.  If a
given document contains multiple applet tags, all the applets will be
loaded, with each applet appearing in its own window.  Likewise, when
multiple URLs are specified, each applet tag instance is given its own
window.  If a given document contains no recognized tags the
`appletviewer' does nothing.

     appletviewer http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/

   Use the second form to test an applet in development.  This form
allows applet tag attributes to be supplied on the command line.  Only
one applet may be specified using the `-code' option.  The `-code'
option overrides the URL form - any URLs specified will be ignored.

     appletviewer -code Test.class -param datafile,data.txt

   `gcjwebplugin' uses the third form to communicate with the
`appletviewer' through named pipes.

   URL OPTIONS
`-debug'
     This option is not yet implemented but is provided for
     compatibility.

`-encoding CHARSET'
     Use this option to specify an alternate character encoding for the
     specified HTML page.


   APPLET TAG OPTIONS
`-code CODE'
     Use the `-code' option to specify the value of the applet tag CODE
     attribute.

`-codebase CODEBASE'
     Use the `-codebase' option to specify the value of the applet tag
     CODEBASE attribute.

`-archive ARCHIVE'
     Use the `-archive' option to specify the value of the applet tag
     ARCHIVE attribute.

`-width WIDTH'
     Use the `-width' option to specify the value of the applet tag
     WIDTH attribute.

`-height HEIGHT'
     Use the `-height' option to specify the value of the applet tag
     HEIGHT attribute.

`-param NAME,VALUE'
     Use the `-param' option to specify values for the NAME and VALUE
     attributes of an applet PARAM tag.


   PLUGIN OPTION
`-plugin INPUT,OUTPUT'
     `gcjwebplugin' uses the `-plugin' option to specify the named pipe
     the `appletviewer' should use for receiving commands (INPUT) and
     the one it should use for sending commands to `gcjwebplugin'
     (OUTPUT).


   DEBUGGING OPTION
`-verbose'
     Use the `-verbose' option to have the `appletviewer' print
     debugging messages.


   STANDARD OPTIONS

`-help'
     Use the `-help' option to have the `appletviewer' print a usage
     message, then exit.

`-version'
     Use the `-version' option to have the `appletviewer' print its
     version, then exit.

`-JOPTION'
     Use the `-J' option to pass OPTION to the virtual machine that
     will run the `appletviewer'.  Unlike other options, there must not
     be a space between the `-J' and OPTION.

1.2 The `gcjwebplugin' Tool
===========================

`gcjwebplugin' is a plugin that adds applet support to web browsers.
Currently `gcjwebplugin' only supports Mozilla-based browsers (e.g.,
Firefox, Galeon, Mozilla).

2 Security Tools
****************

Two Security Tools are available with GNU Classpath: `jarsigner' and
`keytool'.

   To avoid conflicts with other implementations, the jarsigner
executable is called `gjarsigner' and the keytool executable is called
`gkeytool'.

* Menu:

* jarsigner Tool::             Sign and verify .JAR files
* keytool Tool::               Manage private keys and public certificates

   If while using these tools you think you found a bug, then please
report it at classpath-bugs
(http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/bugs.html).


File: cp-tools.info,  Node: jarsigner Tool,  Next: keytool Tool,  Prev: Security Tools,  Up: Security Tools

2.1 The `jarsigner' Tool
========================

The `jarsigner' tool is invoked from the command line, in one of two
forms, as follows:

     jarsigner [OPTION]... FILE ALIAS

     jarsigner `-verify' [OPTION]... FILE

   When the first form is used, the tool signs the designated JAR file.
The second form, on the other hand, is used to verify a previously
signed JAR file.

   FILE is the .JAR file to process; i.e., to sign if the first syntax
form is used, or to verify if the second syntax form is used instead.

   ALIAS must be a known Alias of a Key Entry in the designated Key
Store. The private key material associated with this Alias is then used
for signing the designated .JAR file.

* Menu:

* Common jarsigner Options::   Options used when signing or verifying a file
* Signing Options::            Options only used when signing a .JAR file
* Verification Options::       Options only used when verifying a .JAR file


File: cp-tools.info,  Node: Common jarsigner Options,  Next: Signing Options,  Prev: jarsigner Tool,  Up: jarsigner Tool

2.1.1 Common options
--------------------

The following options may be used when the tool is used for either
signing, or verifying, a .JAR file.

`-verbose'
     Use this option to force the tool to generate more verbose
     messages, during its processing.

`-internalsf'
     When present, the tool will include -which otherwise it does not-
     the `.SF' file in the `.DSA' generated file.

`-sectionsonly'
     When present, the tool will include in the `.SF' generated file
     -which otherwise it does not- a header containing a hash of the
     whole manifest file.  When that header is included, the tool can
     quickly check, during verification, if the hash (in the header)
     matches or not the manifest file.

`-provider PROVIDER_CLASS_NAME'
     A fully qualified class name of a Security Provider to add to the
     current list of Security Providers already installed in the JVM
     in-use. If a provider class is specified with this option, and was
     successfully added to the runtime -i.e. it was not already
     installed- then the tool will attempt to remove this Security
     Provider before exiting.

`-help'
     Prints a help text similar to this one.



File: cp-tools.info,  Node: Signing Options,  Next: Verification Options,  Prev: Common jarsigner Options,  Up: jarsigner Tool

2.1.2 Signing options
---------------------

The following options may be specified when using the tool for signing
purposes.

`-keystore URL'
     Use this option to specify the location of the key store to use.
     The default value is a file URL referencing the file named
     `.keystore' located in the path returned by the call to
     `java.lang.System#getProperty(String)' using `user.home' as
     argument.

     If a URL was specified, but was found to be malformed -e.g.
     missing protocol element- the tool will attempt to use the URL
     value as a file-name (with absolute or relative path-name) of a
     key store -as if the protocol was `file:'.

`-storetype STORE_TYPE'
     Use this option to specify the type of the key store to use. The
     default value, if this option is omitted, is that of the property
     `keystore.type' in the security properties file, which is obtained
     by invoking the static method call `getDefaultType()' in
     `java.security.KeyStore'.

`-storepass PASSWORD'
     Use this option to specify the password which will be used to
     unlock the key store. If this option is missing, the User will be
     prompted to provide a password.

`-keypass PASSWORD'
     Use this option to specify the password which the tool will use to
     unlock the Key Entry associated with the designated Alias.

     If this option is omitted, the tool will first attempt to unlock
     the Key Entry using the same password protecting the key store. If
     this fails, you will then be prompted to provide a password.

`-sigfile NAME'
     Use this option to designate a literal that will be used to
     construct file names for both the `.SF' and `.DSA' signature
     files. These files  will be generated, by the tool, and placed in
     the `META-INF' directory of the signed JAR.  Permissible
     characters for NAME must be in the range "a-zA-Z0-9_-".  All
     characters will be converted to upper-case ones.

     If this option is missing, the first eight characters of the ALIAS
     argument will be used. When this is the case, any character in
     ALIAS that is outside the permissible range of characters will be
     replaced by an underscore.

`-signedjar FILE'
     Use this option to specify the file name of the signed JAR. If
     this option is omitted, then the signed JAR will be named the same
     as FILE; i.e., the input JAR file will be replaced with the signed
     copy.



File: cp-tools.info,  Node: Verification Options,  Prev: Signing Options,  Up: jarsigner Tool

2.1.3 Verification options
--------------------------

The following options may be specified when using the tool for
verification purposes.

`-verify'
     Use this option to indicate that the tool is to be used for
     verification purposes.

`-certs'
     This option is used in conjunction with the `-verbose' option.
     When present, along with the `-verbose' option, the tool will
     print more detailed information about the certificates of the
     signer(s) being processed.



File: cp-tools.info,  Node: keytool Tool,  Prev: jarsigner Tool,  Up: Security Tools

2.2 The `keytool' Tool
======================

Cryptographic credentials, in a Java environment, are usually stored in
a Key Store. The Java SDK specifies a Key Store as a persistent
container of two types of objects: Key Entries and Trusted
Certificates. The security tool `keytool' is a Java-based application
for managing those types of objects.

   A Key Entry represents the private key part of a key-pair used in
Public-Key Cryptography, and a signed X.509 certificate which
authenticates the public key part for a known entity; i.e. the owner of
the key-pair. The X.509 certificate itself contains the public key part
of the key-pair.

   A Trusted Certificate is a signed X.509 certificate issued by a
trusted entity. The Trust in this context is relative to the User of
the `keytool'. In other words, the existence of a Trusted Certificate
in the Key Store processed by a `keytool' command implies that the User
trusts the Issuer of that Trusted Certificate to also sign, and hence
authenticates, other Subjects the tool may process.

   Trusted Certificates are important because they allow the tool to
mechanically construct Chains of Trust starting from one of the Trusted
Certificates in a Key Store and ending with a certificate whose Issuer
is potentially unknown. A valid chain is an ordered list, starting with
a Trusted Certificate (also called the anchor), ending with the target
certificate, and satisfying the condition that the Subject of
certificate `#i' is the Issuer of certificate `#i + 1'.

   The `keytool' is invoked from the command line as follows:

     keytool [COMMAND] ...

   Multiple COMMANDs may be specified at once, each complete with its
own options. `keytool' will parse all the arguments, before processing,
and executing, each `COMMAND'. If an exception occurs while executing
one COMMAND `keytool' will abort. Note however that because the
implementation of the tool uses code to parse command line options that
also supports GNU-style options, you have to separate each command
group with a double-hyphen; e.g

     keytool -list -- -printcert -alias mykey

   Here is a summary of the commands supported by the tool:

  1. Add/Update commands
    `-genkey [OPTION]...'
          Generate a new Key Entry, eventually creating a new key store.

    `-import [OPTION]...'
          Add, to a key store, Key Entries (private keys and
          certificate chains authenticating the public keys) and
          Trusted Certificates (3rd party certificates which can be
          used as Trust Anchors when building chains-of-trust).

    `-selfcert [OPTION]...'
          Generate a new self-signed Trusted Certificate.

    `-cacert [OPTION]...'
          Import a CA Trusted Certificate.

    `-identitydb [OPTION]...'
          NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.
          Import a JDK 1.1 style Identity Database.

  2. Export commands
    `-certreq [OPTION]...'
          Issue a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) which can be then
          sent to a Certification Authority (CA) to issue a certificate
          signed (by the CA) and authenticating the Subject of the
          request.

    `-export [OPTION]...'
          Export a certificate from a key store.

  3. Display commands
    `-list [OPTION]...'
          Print one or all certificates in a key store to `STDOUT'.

    `-printcert [OPTION]...'
          Print a human-readable form of a certificate, in a designated
          file, to `STDOUT'.

  4. Management commands
    `-keyclone [OPTION]...'
          Clone a Key Entry in a key store.

    `-storepasswd [OPTION]...'
          Change the password protecting a key store.

    `-keypasswd [OPTION]...'
          Change the password protecting a Key Entry in a key store.

    `-delete [OPTION]...'
          Delete a Key Entry or a Trusted Certificate from a key store.

2.2.1 Getting help
------------------

To get a general help text about the tool, use the `-help' option; e.g.

     `keytool -help'

   To get more specific help text about one of the tool's command use
the `-help' option for that command; e.g.

     `keytool -genkey -help'

   In both instances, the tool will print a help text and then will
exit the running JVM.

   It is worth noting here that the help messages printed by the tool
are I18N-ready. This means that if/when the contents of the tool's
Message Bundle properties file are available in languages other than
English, you may see those messages in that language.


File: cp-tools.info,  Node: Common keytool Options,  Next: Distinguished Names,  Prev: Getting Help,  Up: keytool Tool

2.2.2 Common options
--------------------

The following `OPTION's are used in more than one `COMMAND'. They are
described here to reduce redundancy.

`-alias ALIAS'
     Every entry, be it a Key Entry or a Trusted Certificate, in a key
     store is uniquely identified by a user-defined ALIAS string. Use
     this option to specify the ALIAS to use when referring to an entry
     in the key store. Unless specified otherwise, a default value of
     `mykey' shall be used when this option is omitted from the command
     line.

`-keyalg ALGORITHM'
     Use this option to specify the canonical name of the key-pair
     generation algorithm. The default value for this option is `DSS'
     (a synonym for the Digital Signature Algorithm also known as DSA).

`-keysize SIZE'
     Use this option to specify the number of bits of the shared
     modulus (for both the public and private keys) to use when
     generating new keys. A default value of `1024' will be used if
     this option is omitted from the command line.

`-validity DAY_COUNT'
     Use this option to specify the number of days a newly generated
     certificate will be valid for. The default value is `90' (days) if
     this option is omitted from the command line.

`-storetype STORE_TYPE'
     Use this option to specify the type of the key store to use. The
     default value, if this option is omitted, is that of the property
     `keystore.type' in the security properties file, which is obtained
     by invoking the static method call `getDefaultType()' in
     `java.security.KeyStore'.

`-storepass PASSWORD'
     Use this option to specify the password protecting the key store.
     If this option is omitted from the command line, you will be
     prompted to provide a password.

`-keystore URL'
     Use this option to specify the location of the key store to use.
     The default value is a file URL referencing the file named
     `.keystore' located in the path returned by the call to
     `java.lang.System#getProperty(String)' using `user.home' as
     argument.

     If a URL was specified, but was found to be malformed -e.g.
     missing protocol element- the tool will attempt to use the URL
     value as a file-name (with absolute or relative path-name) of a
     key store -as if the protocol was `file:'.

`-provider PROVIDER_CLASS_NAME'
     A fully qualified class name of a Security Provider to add to the
     current list of Security Providers already installed in the JVM
     in-use. If a provider class is specified with this option, and was
     successfully added to the runtime -i.e. it was not already
     installed- then the tool will attempt to removed this Security
     Provider before exiting.

`-file FILE'
     Use this option to designate a file to use with a command. When
     specified with this option, the value is expected to be the fully
     qualified path of a file accessible by the File System. Depending
     on the command, the file may be used as input or as output. When
     this option is omitted from the command line, `STDIN' will be used
     instead, as the source of input, and `STDOUT' will be used instead
     as the output destination.

`-v'
     Unless specified otherwise, use this option to enable more verbose
     output.

2.2.3 X.500 Distinguished Names
-------------------------------

A Distinguished Name (or DN) MUST be supplied with some of the
`COMMAND's using a `-dname' option. The syntax of a valid value for
this option MUST follow RFC-2253 specifications. Namely the following
components (with their accepted meaning) will be recognized. Note that
the component name is case-insensitive:

CN
     The Common Name; e.g. `host.domain.com'

OU
     The Organizational Unit; e.g. `IT Department'

O
     The Organization Name; e.g. `The Sample Company'

L
     The Locality Name; e.g. `Sydney'

ST
     The State Name; e.g. `New South Wales'

C
     The 2-letter Country identifier; e.g. `AU'

   When specified with a `-dname' option, each pair of component/value
will be separated from the other with a comma. Each component and value
pair MUST be separated by an equal sign. For example, the following is
a valid DN value:
CN=host.domain.com, O=The Sample Company, L=Sydney, ST=NSW, C=AU

If the Distinguished Name is required, and no valid default value can
be used, the tool will prompt you to enter the information through the
console.

2.2.4.1 The `-genkey' command
.............................

Use this command to generate a new key-pair (both private and public
keys), and save these credentials in the key store as a Key Entry,
associated with the designated (if was specified with the `-alias'
option) or default (if the `-alias' option is omitted) Alias.

   The private key material will be protected with a user-defined
password (see `-keypass' option). The public key on the other hand will
be part of a self-signed X.509 certificate, which will form a 1-element
chain and will be saved in the key store.

`-alias ALIAS'
     For more details *note ALIAS: alias.

`-keyalg ALGORITHM'
     For more details *note ALGORITHM: keyalg.

`-keysize KEY_SIZE'
     For more details *note KEY_SIZE: keysize.

`-sigalg ALGORITHM'
     The canonical name of the digital signature algorithm to use for
     signing certificates. If this option is omitted, a default value
     will be chosen based on the type of the key-pair; i.e., the
     algorithm that ends up being used by the -keyalg option. If the
     key-pair generation algorithm is `DSA', the value for the
     signature algorithm will be `SHA1withDSA'. If on the other hand
     the key-pair generation algorithm is `RSA', then the tool will use
     `MD5withRSA' as the signature algorithm.

`-dname NAME'
     This a mandatory value for the command. If no value is specified
     -i.e. the `-dname' option is omitted- the tool will prompt you to
     enter a Distinguished Name to use as both the Owner and Issuer of
     the generated self-signed certificate.

     For more details *note X.500 DISTINGUISHED NAME: dn.

`-keypass PASSWORD'
     Use this option to specify the password which the tool will use to
     protect the newly created Key Entry.

     If this option is omitted, you will be prompted to provide a
     password.

2.2.4.2 The `-import' command
.............................

Use this command to read an X.509 certificate, or a PKCS#7 Certificate
Reply from a designated input source and incorporate the certificates
into the key store.

   If the Alias does not already exist in the key store, the tool
treats the certificate read from the input source as a new Trusted
Certificate. It then attempts to discover a chain-of-trust, starting
from that certificate and ending at another Trusted Certificate,
already stored in the key store. If the `-trustcacerts' option is
present, an additional key store, of type `JKS' named `cacerts', and
assumed to be present in `${JAVA_HOME}/lib/security' will also be
consulted if found -`${JAVA_HOME}' refers to the location of an
installed Java Runtime Environment (JRE). If no chain-of-trust can be
established, and unless the `-noprompt' option has been specified, the
certificate is printed to `STDOUT' and the user is prompted for a
confirmation.

   If Alias exists in the key store, the tool will treat the
certificate(s) read from the input source as a Certificate Reply, which
can be a chain of certificates, that eventually would replace the chain
of certificates associated with the Key Entry of that Alias. The
substitution of the certificates only occurs if a chain-of-trust can be
established between the bottom certificate of the chain read from the
input file and the Trusted Certificates already present in the key
store. Again, if the `-trustcacerts' option is specified, additional
Trusted Certificates in the same `cacerts' key store will be
considered. If no chain-of-trust can be established, the operation will
abort.

`-alias ALIAS'
     For more details *note ALIAS: alias.

`-file FILE'
     For more details *note FILE: file.

`-keypass PASSWORD'
     Use this option to specify the password which the tool will use to
     protect the Key Entry associated with the designated Alias, when
     replacing this Alias' chain of certificates with that found in the
     certificate reply.

     If this option is omitted, and the chain-of-trust for the
     certificate reply has been established, the tool will first
     attempt to unlock the Key Entry using the same password protecting
     the key store. If this fails, you will then be prompted to provide
     a password.

`-noprompt'
     Use this option to prevent the tool from prompting the user.

`-trustcacerts'
     Use this option to indicate to the tool that a key store, of type
     `JKS', named `cacerts', and usually located in `lib/security' in
     an installed Java Runtime Environment should be considered when
     trying to establish chain-of-trusts.

2.2.4.3 The `-selfcert' command
...............................

Use this command to generate a self-signed X.509 version 1 certificate.
The newly generated certificate will form a chain of one element which
will replace the previous chain associated with the designated Alias
(if `-alias' option was specified), or the default Alias (if `-alias'
option was omitted).

`-alias ALIAS'
     For more details *note ALIAS: alias.

`-sigalg ALGORITHM'
     The canonical name of the digital signature algorithm to use for
     signing the certificate. If this option is omitted, a default
     value will be chosen based on the type of the private key
     associated with the designated Alias. If the private key is a
     `DSA' one, the value for the signature algorithm will be
     `SHA1withDSA'. If on the other hand the private key is an `RSA'
     one, then the tool will use `MD5withRSA' as the signature
     algorithm.

`-dname NAME'
     Use this option to specify the Distinguished Name of the newly
     generated self-signed certificate. If this option is omitted, the
     existing Distinguished Name of the base certificate in the chain
     associated with the designated Alias will be used instead.

.............................

Use this command to import, a CA certificate and add it to the key
store as a Trusted Certificate. The Alias for this new entry will be
constructed from the FILE's base-name after replacing hyphens and dots
with underscores.

   This command is useful when used in a script that recursively visits
a directory of CA certificates to populate a `cacerts.gkr' Key Store of

2.2.5.1 The `-certreq' command
..............................

Use this command to generate a PKCS#10 Certificate Signing Request
(CSR) and write it to a designated output destination. The contents of
the destination should look something like the following:

     -----BEGIN NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
     MI...QAwXzEUMBIGA1UEAwwLcnNuQGdudS5vcmcxGzAZBgNVBAoMElUg

     -----END NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----

   IMPORTANT: Some documentation (e.g. RSA examples) claims that the
`Attributes' field, in the CSR is `OPTIONAL' while RFC-2986 implies the
opposite. This implementation considers this field, by default, as
`OPTIONAL', unless the option `-attributes' is specified on the command

4 Generating HTML Documentation
*******************************

Gjdoc can be used in two ways: as a stand-alone documentation tool, or
as a driver for a user-specified Doclet. *Note Other Doclets::.

   In the default mode, Gjdoc will use the Standard Doclet `HtmlDoclet'
to generate a set of HTML pages.  The canonical usage is:

     gjdoc -s src/java/ -all -d api-docs/

   Here, `src/java/' is the root of your source code class hierarchy,
`-all' means that all valid Java files found under this root directory
should be processed, and `api-docs/' is the directory where the
generated documentation should be placed.

   To learn more about running Doclets other than the Standard Doclet,
refer to the manual.  *Note Invoking a Custom Doclet::.

4.1 Invoking the Standard Doclet
================================

Running the Gjdoc Standard Doclet `HtmlDoclet' is the default mode of
operation for Gjdoc.  This section lists the command line options you
can specify in this mode.  It doesn't distinguish between general Gjdoc
options and options specific to the Standard Doclet.

4.3 Selecting which Source Files to Process
===========================================

`-s PATHLIST'

`-sourcepath PATHLIST'
     Look for source files in the specified directory or directories.

     PATHLIST should be one or more directory paths separated by your
     platform's path separator (usually `:' or `;').

     If this option is not given, `gjdoc' will look for source files in
     the current directory.

     The directories specified should be root directories in terms of
     the Java package system.  For example, if you want to generate
     documentation for classes in package `foo.bar', you must specify
     the directory containing the top-level ``foo'' sub-directory, not
     the directory ``foo/bar/'' in which the Java source files reside.

     The short-hand alias `-s' is specific to `gjdoc' and not
     compatible to Sun `javadoc'.

`-all'
     _[EXPERIMENTAL]_ Process all valid Java source files found in the
     directories listed in the source path and their sub-directories.

     This is an option specific to `gjdoc' and not compatible to Sun
     `javadoc'.

`-subpackages PKG:PKG:...'
     Process the classes in the given Java packages and all
     sub-packages, recursively.  Note that multiple package names must
     be separated with colons instead of whitespace.

`-exclude PKG:PKG:...'
     Do not process classes in the given Java packages and all
     sub-packages, recursively.  This option can be used in conjunction
     with `-all' or `-subpackages' in order to exclude individual
     packages or package sub-trees from the output.

`PACKAGES...'
     Process all classes in the given Java packages.

`SOURCEFILES...'
     Process the classes in the given Java source files.


File: cp-tools.info,  Node: Source Format Options,  Next: Interlinking Options,  Prev: Source Set Options,  Up: gjdoc Tool

4.4 Specifying the Format of Input Files
========================================

`-source RELEASE'
     Assume that the source files are targeted at the given release of
     the Java platform.

     RELEASE should be the version number of a Java platform release in
     the format MAJOR.MINOR, for example `1.4'.

     This option is currently ignored except that an error is raised if
     a release number other than `1.2', `1.3' or `1.4' is specified.

`-encoding CHARSET'
     Assume that the source files are encoded using CHARSET.

     Examples for CHARSET are `US-ASCII', `ISO-8859-1' or `UTF-8'.

     The semantics of CHARSET are identical to those of
     `java.nio.charset.Charset.forName(String)'.

`-breakiterator'
     Use the locale's java.text.BreakIterator instead of the internal
     first sentence detector.

     By default, `gjdoc' uses an internal algorithm to determine where
     a sentence ends. When this option is given, it will instead use
     the `java.text.BreakIterator' instance for the locale given with
     `-locale' (or the default locale).

     This option should be specified when applying `gjdoc' to source
     code commented in a non-latin language for which the default first
     sentence detector does not work. For all other cases, the default
     (do not use BreakIterator) produces better results at the time of
     this writing.


File: cp-tools.info,  Node: Interlinking Options,  Next: Output Control Options,  Prev: Source Format Options,  Up: gjdoc Tool

4.5 Interlinking with other Documentation Sets
==============================================

`-link URL'
     Create hyperlinks to another documentation set.

     By default, `gjdoc' will only create hyperlinks to classes in the
     source set.  Use this option to additionally create hyperlinks to
     classes covered by the specified documentation set.

     URL should be the root URL of the other documentation set. For
     example, to add hyperlinks to GNU Classpath, specify the following:

          -link http://developer.classpath.org/doc/

     The `-link' option can be specified multiple times.

     Note that specifying the `-link' option will cause an HTTP access
     every time gjdoc is invoked. You can use `-linkoffline' instead to
     avoid this access.

`-linkoffline URL FILE'
     Create hyperlinks to another documentation set which is also
     present on the local file system.

     This option works exactly like `-link', except that it accesses
     the local file system instead of the network for determining which
     classes are covered by the linked documentation set.

     When using `-linkoffline' the remote documentation set is not
     accessed at all, which can significantly speed up generation time
     depending on your network connection.  The generated hyperlinks to
     the documentation set however refer to the remote set, not to the
     local one, so that you can distribute the documentation without
     any further dependencies.

     The `-linkoffline' option can be specified multiple times.

`-noqualifier PKG:PKG:...'
     Do not qualify names of classes in the given packages with their
     package name.

     By default, a class name is displayed unqualified only if the
     class is part of the source set or a linked documentation set, and
     qualified with the name of its containing package if it is not.
     You can use this option to force unqualified names for classes
     even if they are not part of the documentation set.

     For example, usually a reference to the String class is represented
     fully-qualified as `java.lang.String' (unless you link to the
     appropriate documentation set using `-link') because it isn't part
     of the documentation set.  You can specify `-noqualifier
     java.lang' to render the same references just as `String'.

     Note that for all unqualified class names, a tooltip is provided
     when you place your mouse pointer over it in the HTML
     documentation.

`-noqualifier `all''
     Omit package name qualifier from all class names.

     Specify this option to omit package name qualifiers altogether,



File: cp-tools.info,  Node: Generation Options,  Next: Decoration Options,  Prev: Output Control Options,  Up: gjdoc Tool

4.6 Selecting which Information to Generate
===========================================

`-public'
     Only include public members of public classes in the output.  By
     default, protected class members are included as well.

`-protected'
     Include public or protected members of public classes in the
     output.  This is the default.

`-package'
     Include public, protected and package-private members of public and
     package-private classes.

`-private'
     Include all classes and class members regardless of their access
     level.

`-splitindex'
     Generate one index page per letter instead of a single, monolithic
     index page.

     By default, the index created by the Standard Doclet contains all
     entries on a single page.  This is fine for small documentation
     sets, but for large sets you should specify this option.

`-nosince'
     Ignore `@since' tags in javadoc comments.

     By default, the generated output contains sections listing the
     version of your API since which the package, class or class member
     in question exists when this tag is encountered.  Specify this
     option to omit this information.

`-notree'
     Do not generate any tree pages.

     By default, the generated output includes one inheritance tree per
     package, and - if the documentation set consists of multiple
     packages - a page with the full inheritance tree.  Specify this
     option to omit generation of these pages.

`-noindex'
     Do not output the alphabetical index.

     By default, gjdoc generates an alphabetical index of all program
     elements in the documentation set (packages, classes, inner
     classes, constructors, methods, and fields).  Specify this option
     to omit this information.

`-nohelp'
     Do not generate the help page.

     This option is currently ignored as the Standard Doclet doesn't
     provide a help page.

`-nodeprecated'
     Do not output inline information about deprecated packages,
     classes or class members.

     By default, the Standard Doclet adds a highlighted paragraph with
     deprecation information to the description of each deprecated
     program element.  Specify this option to omit this information.

`-nodeprecatedlist'
     Do not output the summary page for deprecated API elements.

     By default, the Standard Doclet generates a page listing all
     deprecated API elements along with a deprecation description which
     usually includes the reason for deprecation and possible
     alternatives.  Specify this option to omit this information.

`-nonavbar'
     Do not output the navigation bar, header, and footer.

     By default, each output page is equipped with a top navigation bar
     (which may include a user-specified header) and a bottom navigation
     bar (which may include a user-specified footer).  Specify this
     option to omit this decoration.

`-nocomment'
     Omit all documentation text from the generated files and output
     only declarations and program element relationships.

     This option is here for compatibility with `javadoc'.  If you plan
     on extracting information about your project via `gjdoc', you
     should consider using a different Doclet for your purposes
     instead, for example XmlDoclet.  You could also use the Doclet API
     directly by implementing a new Doclet.

`-linksource'
     Generate a page with syntax-highlighted source code for each class.
     By default, this page is not generated.

     The source code can be accessed by clicking on the button labelled
     "Source" in the navigation bar, or by clicking on the name of a
     constructor, field, method, or inner class in the detail section
     of a class documentation page.

`-use'
     Generate a page with cross-reference information. By default, this
     page is not generated.

     The cross-reference information can be accessed by clicking on the
     button labelled `Use' in the navigation bar.

     The `Use' page lists all classes/interfaces in the documentation
     set that extend/implement the class (type) in question; fields of
     the type; methods or constructors accepting a parameter of the
     type; methods returning the type; and methods or constructors
     throwing the type.

`-author'
     Include author information in the output.

     When specified, author information as specified using the
     `@author' tag in javadoc comments is incorporated into the output.
     By default, `@author' tags are ignored.

`-version'
     Include version information in the output.

     When specified, version information as specified using the
     `@version' tag in javadoc comments is incorporated into the
     output. By default, `@version' tags are ignored.

`-licensetext'
     Assume that the first comment in each source file contains the
     license text, and add license information to the footer of each
     generated class page.

     This is an option specific to `gjdoc' and not compatible to Sun
     `javadoc'.

     This option is intended for use with free and open source projects
     where source code is typically prefixed with a boilerplate license
     comment, when there are legal reasons for including the license in
     the documentation.

`-docfilessubdirs'
     Recursively copy all files in the `doc-files' sub-directory of each
     package directory.

     Usually, only the files in the `doc-files' sub-directory are copied
     without descending recursively.

     *Note Adding Custom Resources::.

`-excludedocfilessubdir NAME:NAME:...'
     Do not copy some directories directly under the `doc-files'
     sub-directories when descending recursively.

     The argument to this option should be a colon-separated list of
     directory names.

     This option only makes sense if `-docfilessubdirs' is also
     specified.  In this case, any sub-directory located directly
     beneath a `doc-files' directory is omitted if listed.

4.7 Custom Documentation Tags
=============================

`-tagletpath PATHLIST'
     Search PATHLIST when loading subsequent Taglet classes specified
     using `-taglet'.

     PATHLIST should be one or more paths to a directory or jar file,
     separated by your platform's path separator (usually `:' or `;').

`-taglet CLASSNAME'
     Register a Taglet.

     CLASSNAME should be the fully-qualified name of a Java class
     implementing `com.sun.tools.doclets.Taglet'.

     The Taglet classes will be loaded from the classpath specified
     using `-tagletpath', from the classpath specified using
     `-classpath' and from the default classpath.

     See the documentation of `com.sun.tools.doclets.Taglet' for
     further information.

     Note that for simple tags, there is also `-tag'.

`-tag TAGSPEC'
     Register a generic Taglet.

     The format of TAGSPEC must be `<tagname>:<flags>:"<taghead>"'.

     TAGNAME is the tag name to match, without the leading @ sign.

     FLAGS is one or more of the following characters, where each
     character specifies a source code context in which the tag is to be
     recognized.

    `a'
          all contexts

    `c'
          constructors

    `f'
          fields

    `m'
          methods

    `o'
          overview

    `p'
          packages

    `t'
          types (classes, interfaces, exceptions, errors)

    `X'
          special character which temporarily disables the Taglet
          altogether.

     TAGHEAD is the string to display in the header of the section
     devoted to the tag in question.

     For example, to define a tag matching `@cvsid' which is to be
     accepted in overview, package and type pages and which is labelled
     with the header `CVS ID', you would specify:

          -tag cvsid:tpo:"CVS ID"

     Let's say that a class javadoc comment contains

          @cvsid $Id: cp-tools.texinfo,v 1.7 2008/08/13 13:32:05 jsumali Exp $

     Then the HTML output will contain something like

          CVS ID:
            $Id: cp-tools.texinfo,v 1.7 2008/08/13 13:32:05 jsumali Exp $

     Search PATHLIST when loading classes for the Doclet specified
     using `-doclet'.

     PATHLIST should be one or more paths to a directory or jar file,
     separated by your platform's path separator (usually `:' or `;').

`-doclet CLASSNAME'
     Run the specified doclet instead of the standard HtmlDoclet.

     CLASSNAME should be the fully-qualified name of a class which has
     a public default constructor and contain a method with the
     following signature:

             import com.sun.javadoc.RootDoc;
             public static boolean start(RootDoc rootDoc)

     The Doclet classes will be loaded from the classpath specified
     using `-docletpath', from the classpath specified using
     `-classpath' and from the default classpath.

     The `start' method should process the information exposed by the
     Doclet API via `rootDoc' and return `true' on success, `false' on
     failure.

     If you are using a third-party doclet, refer to its documentation
     for further instructions.  Note that support for third-party
     doclets is experimental.  Please report any problems you
     encounter, or provide feedback when successfully running
     third-party applets.

     This option can be specified multiple times, in which case all
     doclets are executed with the same information tree exposed via
     the Doclet API for each Doclet run.

4.9 Adding Information to the Output
====================================

`-windowtitle TEXT'
     Use TEXT as the browser window title prefix.

     When specified, the browser window title for each page will be
     prefixed with TEXT instead of the default string `Generated API
     Documentation'.

     TEXT should be plain text (it should not contain HTML tags).

`-doctitle TEXT'
     Set the header text of the overview page to TEXT.

     TEXT should be a short plain text string.

     When generating documentation for a single package, specifying this
     option forces generation of the overview page.

`-header HTMLTEXT'
     Add HTMLTEXT to the right upper corner of every generated page.
     HTMLTEXT is usually set to the name of the project being
     documented.

`-footer HTMLTEXT'
     Add HTMLTEXT to the right bottom corner of every generated page.
     HTMLTEXT is often set to the same value as for `-header'.

`-bottom HTMLTEXT'
     Add HTMLTEXT to the very bottom of every generated page, spanning
     the whole width of the page.  When specified, HTMLTEXT usually
     consists of a copyright notice and/or links to other project pages.

`-addstylesheet FILE'
     Augment the default CSS style sheets with the user-specified
     stylesheet FILE.

     The given stylesheet is simply loaded by each HTML page in
     addition to the default ones, as the last stylesheet.

     Note that the CSS cascading rules apply.  That is, your style
     properties will only be assigned if they have a higher cascading
     order than `gjdoc''s default style.  One simple way to make sure
     that this is the case is to declare your overrides `!important'.

     See `http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/cascade.html#cascading-order'.

`-group HEADING PKGWILDCARD:PKGWILDCARD:...'
     Arrange the given packages in a separate group on the overview
     page.

     The first argument should be a short plain text which is used as
     the title of the package group.  The second argument should be a
     colon-separated list of package wildcards.  The group will consist
     of all packages in the documentation set whose name matches any of
     the given wildcards.

     There is only one wildcard character, `*', which matches both
     letters in package name components and the `.' separating package
     name components.  For example, `j*regex' would match package
     `java.util.regex'.  A more useful example would be `javax.swing*'
     to match `javax.swing' and all of its sub-packages.

     This option can be given multiple times.

     FIXME: Information about group nesting here.

          gjdoc -group "Core Classes" 'java*' \
                -group "Swing" 'javax.swing*' \
                -group "XML APIs" 'javax.xml*' \
                -group "Other Extensions" javax* \
                ...

`-overview FILE'
     Add the XHTML body fragment from FILE to the overview page.

     FILE should contain an XHTML fragment with the HTML `body' tag as
     the root node.  *Note XHTML Fragments::.

     This option can be used to supply a description of the
     documentation set as a whole.

     When specified, the first sentence of the fragment will be put
     above the tables listing the documented packages, along with a
     link to the full copy of the fragment which is put below the
     tables.  *Note First Sentence Detector::.

     When generating documentation for a single package, specifying this
     option forces generation of the overview page.

`-stylesheetfile FILE'
     Use the CSS stylesheet in FILE instead of the default CSS
     stylesheets.

     If you only want to override parts of the default stylesheets, use
     `-addstylesheet' instead.

`-title TEXT'
     _Deprecated._ Use `-doctitle' TEXT instead.

`-helpfile FILE'
     This option is currently ignored.

     When implemented, it will use the XHTML fragment in FILE for the
     help page contents instead of the default help text.



File: cp-tools.info,  Node: Output Control Options,  Next: Generation Options,  Prev: Interlinking Options,  Up: gjdoc Tool

4.10 Controlling the Output.
============================

`-d DIRECTORY'
     Place all output files into DIRECTORY (and sub-directories).
     DIRECTORY will be created if it does not exist, including all
     non-existing parent directories and all required sub-directories.

     If not specified, output will be placed into the current directory.

`-locale NAME'
     Use locale NAME instead of the default locale for all purposes.

     NAME should be a locale specifier in the form `ll_CC[_VAR]' where
     `ll' is a lowercase two-letter ISO-639 language code, `CC' is an
     optional uppercase two-letter ISO-3166 country code, and `VAR' is
     an optional variant code.  For example, `en' specifies English,
     `en_US' specifies US English, and `en_US_WIN' specifies a deviant
     variant of the US English locale.

     Note that the semantics of this option correspond exactly to those
     of the constructors of class `java.util.Locale'.

     This option currently only determines which Collator is being used
     for sorting output elements.  This means that the locale will only
     have an effect when you are using non-ASCII characters in
     identifiers.

`-charset CHARSET'
     _Deprecated._ Override the specified encoding in output XHTML
     files with the one given by `charset'.

     If this option is not given, the encoding specification in output
     XHTML is chosen to match the encoding used when writing the file
     (the encoding given with `-docencoding', or your platform's default
     encoding).

     The semantics for CHARSET are specified here:
     `http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#NT-EncName'.  For all
     practical purposes, they are identical to those of the other
     options accepting charset parameters.

     This option is here for compatibility with `javadoc' and should be
     avoided.

`-docencoding CHARSET'
     Use the given charset encoding when writing output files instead of
     your platform's default encoding.

     Examples for CHARSET are `US-ASCII', `ISO-8859-1' or `UTF-8'.

     The semantics of this option correspond exactly to those of the
     constructors of class `java.util.Locale'.

`-validhtml'
     Force generation of valid XHTML code.  This breaks compatibility to
     the traditional Javadoc tool to some extent.

     If this option is specified, anchor names will be mangled so that
     they are valid according to the XHTML 1.1 specification.  However,
     a documentation set generated with this option cannot be linked to
     properly using the traditional Javadoc tool.  It can be linked to
     just fine using Gjdoc, though.

     Without this option, anchor names for executable class members use
     the traditional format, for example: "foo(String,int[])".  This is
     compatible to the traditional Javadoc tool, but according to both
     the HTML 4.0 and XHTML 1.0 and 1.1 specifications, this format
     includes illegal characters.  Parentheses, square brackets, and
     the comma are not allowed in anchor names.

`-baseurl URL'
     Hardwire a page URL relative to URL into each generated page.

     If you are generating documentation which will exclusively be
     available at a certain URL, you should use this option to specify
     this URL.

     This can help avoid certain redirect attacks used by spammers, and
     it can be helpful for certain web clients.

File: cp-tools.info,  Node: Virtual Machine Options,  Next: Verbosity Options,  Prev: Taglet Options,  Up: gjdoc Tool

4.12 Virtual Machine Options
============================

Sun's `javadoc' tool seems to be based on `javac' and as such it seems
to operate on the VM level.  `gjdoc', in contrast, is a pure Java
application.

   Therefore, `gjdoc' can only fake, or simulate, the following
VM-level options.

`-classpath PATHLIST'
     Set the Virtual Machine `classpath' to PATHLIST.

     In most cases you should use `-docletpath' or `-tagletpath'
     instead of this option.

     PATHLIST should be one or more paths to a directory or jar file,
     separated by your platform's path separator (usually `:' or `;').

     If this option is not intercepted at the wrapper level, `gjdoc'
     currently fakes it by calling
     `System.setProperty("java.class.path", PATHLIST);' and outputs a
     warning.

`-bootclasspath PATHLIST'
     Set the Virtual Machine `bootclasspath' to PATHLIST.

     If this option is not intercepted at the wrapper level, `gjdoc'
     outputs a warning.

`-JVMOPT'
     Pass an arbitrary parameter to the Virtual Machine `gjdoc' runs on.

     If this option is not intercepted at the wrapper level, `gjdoc'
     tries to emulate the option and outputs a warning.

     Currently, only the VM option `-D' for setting system properties
     is emulated.

4.13 Invoking a Custom Doclet
=============================

For invoking one of the other doclets shipping with `gjdoc' or a

       -docletpath /path/to/doclet.jar -doclet foo.BarDoclet \
       (more Gjdoc core options and Doclet-specific options here)

   `/path/to/doclet.jar' is a placeholder for a class path specifying
where the Doclet classes and dependencies can be found and
`foo.BarDoclet' is the fully-qualified name of the Doclet's main class.

File: cp-tools.info,  Node: Doclet Invocation Interface,  Next: Using AbstractDoclet,  Up: Writing Doclets

6.2.1 Implementing the Doclet Invocation Interface
--------------------------------------------------

A Doclet is a class that contains a method with the following signature:

     public static boolean start(RootDoc rootDoc);

   ROOTDOC is the root of an object hierarchy containing the
information `gjdoc' extracted from the source files.  See the Doclet
API for more details.

   `start' should process all the information and return `true' on
success, `false' on failure.

   For printing status information, the Doclet should use methods
`printNotice', `printWarning' and `printError' instead of `System.err'.
The Doclet can opt to use `System.out' for redirectable output.


File: cp-tools.info,  Node: Using AbstractDoclet,  Next: GNU Doclet SPI,  Prev: Doclet Invocation Interface,  Up: Writing Doclets

6.2.2 Deriving Your Doclet from AbstractDoclet
----------------------------------------------

You may want your Doclet to provide functionality similar to
HtmlDoclet.  For example, you may want it to support Taglets, generate
Index, Tree, and Uses pages, or show other cross-reference information
like `Overrides' and `All Implementing Classes'.

   This information is not directly provided by the Doclet API, so your
Doclet would normally have to assemble it itself.  For example, it
would have to add the names of all program elements to a list and sort
this list in order to create the Index page.

   If you want to provide this information or part of it, you should
consider deriving your class from
`gnu.classpath.tools.doclets.AbstractDoclet'.  This class provides the
following benefits:

   * Handles options `-tag', `-taglet', `-tagletpath' (Taglets)

   * Provides standard taglets for @version, @author, @since, @serial,
     @deprecated, @see, @param, @return and handles all related options
     (`-version', `-author', `-nosince', `-nodeprecated')

   * Handles option `-d' (destination directory)

   * Handles option `-noqualifier' (classes to omit qualifier for)

   * Handles options `-docfilessubdirs' and `-excludedocfilessubdir'
     (resource copying)

   * Can generate a full index or an index split by first letter

   * Can generate a full tree and package trees

   * Can generate cross-reference information

   * Can aggregate interface information (all superinterfaces, all
     subinterfaces, all implementing classes)

   * Provides convenient access to constructors, fields, methods, and
     inner classes sorted by name/signature instead of the default sort
     order.

   * Provides various other convenience methods


   If you derive from `AbstractDoclet', there are a number of things
you need to take care of:

   *
   you should not implement the `start(RootDoc)' method as it is
already defined by `AbstractDoclet' so that it can care about parsing
the options.

   Instead, you implement method `run()', `getOptions()' and the other
abstract methods to define your Doclet's behavior.

   Note that all information provided by `AbstractDoclet' is evaluated
lazily.  That is, if your Doclet doesn't need to create an Index page,
then `AbstractDoclet' will not spend resources on creating the
corresponding information.

   See the API documentation for
`gnu.classpath.tools.doclets.AbstractDoclet' for more details.

   You should be aware that if you base your Doclet on `AbstractDoclet'
then you have to bundle this and all related classes with your Doclet,
with all implications such as possible licensing issues.  Otherwise,
your Doclet will only be runnable on `gjdoc' and not on other
documentation systems.  Also note that `AbstractDoclet' has not been
extensively tested in environments other than `gjdoc'.


File: cp-tools.info,  Node: GNU Doclet SPI,  Prev: Using AbstractDoclet,  Up: Writing Doclets

6.2.3 Preparing for the GNU Doclet Service Provider Interface
-------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the standard Doclet invocation interface described
above, `gjdoc' also offers a Service Provider Interface conforming to
the Java standard.  Adding support for this interface to your Doclet
simplifies usage for `gjdoc' users because it makes your Doclet
"discoverable".

   In order to provide the alternate interface, you have to add a class
implementing `gnu.classpath.tools.gjdoc.spi.DocletSpi' to your Doclet
classes, and bundle all Doclet classes in a Jar file along with a file
named `META_INF/services/gnu.classpath.tools.gjdoc.spi.DocletSpi' which
contains the name of your class implementing DocletSpi on a single line.

   Note that if your Doclet depends on third-party classes bundled in
separate Jar files, you can link in these classes using the
`Class-path:' Manifest attribute of your Doclet Jar.

   Your Doclet can then be invoked in one of the following ways:
     gjdoc -docletjar /path/to/doclet.jar
     gjdoc -docletpath /path/to/doclet.jar -docletname DOCLETNAME
     gjdoc -docletname DOCLETNAME

   Here, DOCLETNAME is the name of your doclet as returned by
`DocletSpi.getDocletName()'.

   The last example will only work if your Doclet Jar is in `gjdoc''s
`doclets' directory or if it is on the classpath.


File: cp-tools.info,  Node: XHTML Fragments,  Next: First Sentence Detector,  Prev: Writing Doclets,  Up: Gjdoc Concepts

6.3 Well-formed Documentation Fragments
=======================================

For many Doclets it is advantagous if the HTML code in the comments and
HTML code passed via the command line is well-formed.  For example,
HtmlDoclet outputs XHTML code, and XmlDoclet XML code, both of which
results in invalid files if the user-specified HTML isn't wellformed.

   Unfortunately, comments were never required to contain well-formed
HTML code, which means that every Doclet must deal with non-wellformed
code as well.

   The `gjdoc' built-in Doclets deal with this problem by "fixing" the
HTML code - making sure that all tags are closed, attribute values are
provided and quoted, tags are properly nested, etc.

   This approach works OK in most instances, but since it uses some
crude heuristics it can sometimes produce undesirable result.

   Therefore, in order to make sure that your comments are always
properly formatted, make sure they are well-formed as described in
XHTML 1.0: Documents must be well-formed (http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#h-4.1).

   In addition, you should use meaningful tags instead of text
formatting tags to make your output look better in other output formats
derived from your HTML code.  For example, you should use the <em> tag
instead of <b> if you want to emphasize text.


File: cp-tools.info,  Node: First Sentence Detector,  Next: Adding Custom Resources,  Prev: XHTML Fragments,  Up: Gjdoc Concepts

6.4 How Gjdoc Determines where the First Sentence Ends
======================================================

For a package, class or member summary, `gjdoc' only shows the first
sentence of the documentation comment in question.  Because `gjdoc' is
not human, it is not always obvious to `gjdoc' where the first sentence
ends.

   You might be tempted to say that the first sentence ends at the first
occurrence of a punctuation character like `.' or `!'. However,
consider examples like this:
     This work, by Thomas J. Shahan et al., is about the middle ages.

   As you can see, it is not trivial to determine the end of the
sentence.

   `gjdoc' gives you the choice between two approaches.  By default it
uses built-in heuristics which should be compatible to Sun's `javadoc'
tool.  This approach works quiet well in most cases, at least for
english comments.

   Alternatively, you can specify option `-breakiterator' in which case
`gjdoc' will use
`java.text.BreakIterator.getSentenceInstance(LOCALE).next()' to find
the end of sentence, where LOCALE is the locale specified by option
`-locale' or the default locale if none specified.

   _NOT YET IMPLEMENTED:_

   `gjdoc' also allows you to explicitly delineate the first sentence
by putting it in a `<span>' tag with the CSS class `first-sentence'.
For example:
     /**
      *  <span class="first-sentence">This. is. the. first.
      *  sentence.</span> This is the second sentence.
      */

   Note that this will only work with `gjdoc', but shouldn't hurt when
using another documentation system since the `<span>' tag usually
doesn't show up in the output.


File: cp-tools.info,  Node: Adding Custom Resources,  Prev: First Sentence Detector,  Up: Gjdoc Concepts

6.5 Adding Images and Other Resources
=====================================

Sometimes you want to decorate your documentation with secondary
resources such as images, SVG graphics, applets, and so on.  To do so,
simply put the required files in a subdirectory 'doc-files' in the
package directory corresponding to the documentation entry you want to
decorate, and refer to it with the URL `doc-files/FILENAME'.

   For example, if you want to add an image to the description of class
`baz.FooBar', create a directory `doc-files' in the directory `baz'
containing `FooBar.java' and put your file, say `diagram.png', into
that directory.  Then, add the HTML code like this to a comment in
`FooBar.java':
     <img src="doc-files/diagram.png" width="200" height="150"
       alt="Foo Diagram"/>

   This works because the `doc-files' subdirectories will be copied to
the target documentation directory every time you generate the
documentation.

   Note however that by default, the `doc-files' directory will not be
copied deeply.  In other words, if you create subdirectories under
`doc-files' they will not be copied and any resources located in these
subdirectories will not be accessible in your generated documentation.
You can specify option `-docfilessubdirs' to remove this limitation.

   Sometimes you want to use option `-docfilessubdirs', but there are
certain directories which you don't want to be copied, for example
because they contain source files for the resources in `doc-files'.
For cases like this, use `-excludedocfilessubdir' to specify
directories to be omitted.

File: cp-tools.info,  Node: Language Resources,  Next: Message Formats,  Prev: I18N Issues,  Up: I18N Issues

7.1 Language-specific resources
===============================

The Tools use Java `ResourceBundle's to store messages, and message
templates they use at runtime to generate the message text itself,
depending on the locale in use at the time.

   The Resource Bundles these tools use are essentially Java Properties
files consisting of a set of Name/Value pairs. The Name is the Property
Name and the Value is a substitution string that is used when the code
references the associated Name. For example the following is a line in
a Resource Bundle used by the `keytool' Tool:

     Command.23=A correct key password MUST be provided

   When the tool needs to signal a mandatory but missing key password,
it would reference the property named `Command.23' and the message "`A
correct key password MUST be provided'" will be used instead. This
indirect referencing of "resources" permits replacing, as late as
possible, the English strings with strings in other languages, provided
of course Resource Bundles in those languages are provided.

   For the GNU Classpath Tools described in this Guide, the Resource
Bundles are files named `messages[_ll[_CC[_VV]]].properties' where:

LL
     Is the 2-letter code for the Language,

CC
     Is the 2-letter code for the Region, and

VV
     Is the 2-letter code for the Variant of the language.

   The complete list of language codes can be found at Code for the
representation of names of languages
(http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso639.txt). A similar
list for the region codes can be found at ISO 3166 Codes (Countries)
(http://userpage.chemie.fu-berlin.de/diverse/doc/ISO_3166.html).

   The location of the Resource Bundles for the GNU Classpath Tools is
specific to each tool. The next table shows where these files are found
in a standard GNU Classpath distribution:

`jarsigner'
     `gnu/classpath/tools/jarsigner'

`keytool'
     `gnu/classpath/tools/keytool'

   The collection of Resource Bundles in a location act as an inverted
tree with a parent-child relationship. For example suppose in the
`gnu/classpath/tools/keytool' there are 3 message bundles named:

  1. `messages.properties'

  2. `messages_fr.properties'

  3. `messages_fr_FR.properties'

   In the above example, bundle #1 will act as the parent of bundle #2,
which in turn will act as the parent for bundle #3. This ordering is
used by the Java runtime to choose which file to load based on the set
Locale. For example if the Locale is `fr_CH', `messages_fr.properties'
will be used because (a) `messages_fr_CH.properties' does not exist,
but (b) `messages_fr.properties' is the parent for the required bundle,
and it exists. As another example, suppose the Locale was set to
`en_AU'; then the tool will end up using `messages.properties' because
(a) `messages_en_AU.properties' does not exist, (b)
`messages_en.properties' which is the parent for the required bundle
does not exist, but (c) `messages.properties' exists and is the root of
the hierarchy.

   You can see from the examples above that `messages.properties' is
the safety net that the Java runtime falls back to when failing to find
a specific bundle and its parent(s). This file is always provided with
the Tool. In time, more localized versions will be included to cater
for other languages.

   In the meantime, if you are willing to contribute localized versions
of these resources, grab the `messages.properties' for a specific tool;
translate it; save it with the appropriate language and region suffix
and mail it to `classpath@gnu.org'.

7.2 Message formats
===================

If you open any of the `messages.properties' described in the previous
section, you may see properties that look like so:

     Command.67=Issuer: {0}
     Command.68=Serial number: {0,number}
     Command.69=Valid from: {0,date,full} - {0,time,full}
     Command.70=\ \ \ \ \ until: {0,date,full} - {0,time,full}

   These are Message Formats used by the tools to customize a text
string that will then be used either as a prompt for User input or as
output.

   If you are translating a `messages.properties' be careful not to
alter text between curly braces.
